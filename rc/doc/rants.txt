- ruby on this system was 1.9.1. Installed rails for it. That won't work
- Installed ruby 1.9.2. Installed rails
- tried installing Rdiscount - markdown interpreter - fail
- tried installing mysql2 -failed
- The above two failed because the rubyinstaller doesn't now come with the _devkit_ within it.
This devkit is the thing that brings very essential *nix domain tools - gcc, sh, make etc to win platform.
The problem here was, gems that have C/c++ code (extensions) within them (native rubygems) will not work if not compiled, for which the devkit is necessary. Go through its installation steps to get it done(http://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit)

- mysql2 installation will still fail. This is because mysql2 gem is not yet supported for Windows.
Postgres also has problems in rails-3 on windows. SO installed sqlite3
