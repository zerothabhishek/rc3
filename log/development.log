It is primarily used as an OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) database in environments requiring high availability, like stock-markets and banking. It has three major components - the executer, 
the compiler and utilities. 
My role involved total ownership of the utility components, and maintenance tasks in the other components. 
The utility components are - 


BACKUP RESTORE: 
About the component: 
It is a generic agent to backup and restore the database. Written in C++. 
My contribution: 
Re-wrote of the filter - the feature for semantic checks for the backup and restore objects.
